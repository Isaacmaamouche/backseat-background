I love that show so much, it's a great way to keep myself informed.
On stage, Tvs display their logos with a cool animation.
This project idea was to reproduce it and allow control over the displayed logo.

## How to

You can either click/touch on the logo itself to cycle through them,
or (only on computers) you select one by moving your mouse to the top left of the screen to display a menu.
Using the menu update the logo list to preserve the flow of cycling when you click/touch the logo.
